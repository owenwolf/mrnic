                                <h2>Lac de Nicaragua; Atlas Géographique et Physique du Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne</h2><br>
                                <p>LAKE OF NICARAGUA; GEOGRAPHIC AND PHYSICAL ATLAS OF THE KINGDOM OF NEW SPAIN</p><br>
                                <p>The renowned Prussian explorer and scientist, von Humboldt, visited New Spain (Mexico and Central America) at the begin ning of the 19TH century and years later produced an atlas of New Spain in Paris. On a page of this
                                    atlas, he shows "the points of projected communications between the Great Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean." And on this page, Humboldt included this map of Nicaragua showing that at this early date Nicaragua's privileged
                                    geographic location made it a prime candidate for canal.</p><br>
                                <p>Von Humboldt never visited Nicaragua but it is obvious from this map that he and his team of cartographers had had access to maps of the then provinces of the Kingdom of Guatemala, including Nicaragua.</p><br>
                                <p>The principal reason why this map has been included in this book is because its author was the most celebrated explor er and scientist of his age. He was, in fact, the same man whose experiments off the Pacific coast of
                                    Peru caused him to discov er the existence of a current, which today bears his name, and where the existence of the weather phenomenon known today as "el Niño" was first noted.</p><br>
                                <p>One final curious note. Of all the maps in this book, this is the only one whose reproduced image is larger than the origi nal. This is because the original map was one of several which appeared on the same page of von
                                    Humboldt's atlas. Hence it had to be small. But in this publication there was sufficient space to permit its amplification.</p>

                                <p>A small French map of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, it appeared in a maritime atlas whose cover can also be seen on the oppo site page. It is of historical value to us because of its age, 238 years, and because it focuses on
                                    our country and Costa Rica. Interestingly, the River of the Disaster is shown on the Atlantic Coast. This must be the same river that Columbus named when two of his sailors drowned in it in 1502 (see the Prologue to
                                    this book). Nonetheless, it appears north of Cape Gracias a Dioswell north of the entrance to Bluefields Bay, its correct location.</p><br>

                                    of the Audiencia de Guatimala [sic]. The cities of Leon, Granada and Masaya appear in the map as does the San Juan River, which is referred to as the "Desaguadero" (a Spanish word that means drain), as it was originally
                                    called. The Mombacho volcano is also depicted in the map.</p><br>
                                <p>As frequently occurred in maps this old, it contains serious errors. The Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, for instance, appears in Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast region and Contales (the modern-day Chontales) is shown in Honduras
                                    instead of Nicaragua, where it is actually located. Finally, Lake Managua appears as part of Lake Nicaragua.</p>

                                <p>MAP OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA This is a map in Latin of North and Central America. It shows the British North American colonies that would declare their independence 54 years later, triggering the independence movement in the
                                    New World that would eventually lead Mexico and Central America to break with Spain in 1821. The map also contains an interesting reference to the Apache Indians in the area identified as New Mexico.</p><br>
                                <p>Central America is depicted as a part of New Spain though it is labeled the Audiencia de Guatemala. Lakes Nicaragua and Managua appear as one, a common mistake in maps of this era. And the map also shows the San Juan River
                                    as the "Desaguadero," its original name, which means "drain" in Spanish. Leon and Granada, the two most important colonial towns in Nicaragua, are also shown.</p><br>
                                <p>Thought to have been produced in 1722, the map clearly shows the island of San Andres as belonging to the Vice Royalty of New Spain.</p>
